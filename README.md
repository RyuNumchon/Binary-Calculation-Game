# Simon_Say_Game
A Simon Say Game: Arduino project.

Required components:
a) 1 Arduino Board
b) 5 switches
c) 5 LEDs
d) 10 220-Ohm resisotrs
e) wires

Explaination: 
The Simon Says game project involves building an electronic game using an Arduino board, switches, LEDs, a 7-segment display, resistors, and wires. The game involves the generation of a random sequence of LED flashes, which the player must then repeat by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order. The game has now been enhanced to include an additional LED that indicates whether the player needs to perform the action or skip the turn, and a switch that allows the player to skip their turn. The game has also been expanded to include 10 levels of increasing difficulty, with each level having a longer and faster sequence. When the player reaches level 10, all LEDs light up to indicate the winning state
